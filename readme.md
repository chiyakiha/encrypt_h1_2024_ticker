### Encryption half 1

This is a mirror of the original project.

Main directory: `encr/src`     
Select a specific encoder/decoder: `Main`     
Base64 encoder/decoder: `b64_dc`/`b64_mst`     
Normal shift encoding: `conv_dc`/`conv_mst`     
Kanji encoding: `jax_dc`/`jax_mst`     
Kanji dictionary: `jax3`     

To run all three rounds at once, use `combi`/`combi_dc`.

Some methods were re-implemented in `combi` versus their individual counterparts,
so the use behaviour may appear differently.
